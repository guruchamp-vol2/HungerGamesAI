## Dynamic AI Examples

**Same action, different results based on variables:**

**Player A (High Knowledge, Survivalist, Storm Approaching):**
> "You use your extensive knowledge to locate a natural spring that's been revealed by the approaching storm. The water is crystal clear and pure, flowing from deep underground sources."

**Player B (Low Knowledge, Aggressive, Quiet Period):**
> "You search for water and find a small pool. The water is murky but flowing, which reduces the risk of contamination. You drink cautiously, hoping it won't make you sick."

**Player C (High Agility, Cautious, Supply Drop):**
> "Your agility allows you to climb down a steep embankment to reach a hidden pool of water. Other tributes would never find this spot. The water is fresh and clean, protected from contamination."
