-> mentor_scene

=== mentor_scene ===
Your mentor pulls you into a dark corner.

* Pick a med-kit
    Your mentor hands you a small medical kit. "This could save your life," she whispers. "It contains bandages, antiseptic, and painkillers. Use it wisely." You carefully tuck it into your pocket, feeling a bit more prepared for what lies ahead.
    ~ player_inventory = "Med-kit"
    -> training_start
* Pick throwing knives
    Your mentor produces a set of finely crafted throwing knives. "These are balanced perfectly," she explains. "They're small enough to hide, but deadly in the right hands. Practice with them every chance you get." You test the weight of one in your hand - it feels natural, like an extension of your arm.
    ~ player_weapon = "Throwing knives"
    -> training_start
* Pick a rope & trap kit
    Your mentor gives you a bundle containing rope, wire, and various small tools. "This is for setting traps and moving quietly," she says. "The rope can be used for climbing, binding, or even as a weapon. The wire is perfect for snares." You nod, understanding the value of stealth in the arena.
    ~ player_inventory = "Rope & trap kit"
    -> training_start

=== training_start ===
You enter the Capitol training center.

-> train_day_1

=== train_day_1 ===
Day 1 of training. Choose your activity:

* Practice with a spear
    You spend hours practicing with the spear, learning its balance and reach. The weapon feels powerful in your hands, and you quickly develop a rhythm. Your instructor shows you proper throwing techniques and close combat moves. By the end of the day, your arms are sore but you feel more confident with your chosen weapon.
    ~ player_strength += 2
    -> train_day_2
* Study edible plants
    You spend the day with a botanist, learning to identify edible plants, berries, and roots. You memorize the distinctive features of safe plants and the warning signs of poisonous ones. "This knowledge could keep you alive longer than any weapon," the botanist tells you. You carefully sketch the plants in your mind, determined to remember every detail.
    ~ player_knowledge += 2
    -> train_day_2
* Observe other tributes
    You spend the day watching the other tributes train, studying their strengths and weaknesses. You notice patterns in their movements, their preferred weapons, and how they interact with each other. Some form alliances, others work alone. You file away every detail, knowing this information could be crucial in the arena.
    ~ player_knowledge += 1
    ~ player_stealth += 1
    -> train_day_2

=== train_day_2 ===
Day 2 of training. Choose your activity:

* Practice stealth techniques
    You work with a master of stealth, learning to move silently and remain unseen. You practice camouflage techniques, how to read the environment for hiding spots, and the art of patience. "In the arena, sometimes the best weapon is invisibility," your instructor tells you. You feel more confident in your ability to avoid detection.
    ~ player_stealth += 2
    -> train_day_3
* Study survival skills
    You learn essential survival techniques - how to find clean water, build shelters, start fires, and navigate by the stars. The instructor emphasizes the importance of staying calm under pressure. "Panic kills more tributes than weapons," he says. You absorb every lesson, knowing your life may depend on it.
    ~ player_knowledge += 1
    ~ player_strength += 1
    -> train_day_3
* Practice hand-to-hand combat
    You spend the day learning close combat techniques. The training is intense and physically demanding, but you quickly improve. Your instructor teaches you how to use your opponent's strength against them and how to fight dirty when necessary. "In the arena, there are no rules," he reminds you.
    ~ player_strength += 2
    -> train_day_3

=== train_day_3 ===
Day 3 of training. Choose your weapon specialization:

* Spear

    ~ player_weapon = "Spear"
    -> arena_intro
* Bow and arrows
    You choose the bow as your weapon. It requires skill and patience, but offers the advantage of distance. You practice until you can hit targets consistently. The bow becomes your trusted companion.
    ~ player_weapon = "Bow and arrows"
    -> arena_intro
* Throwing knives

    ~ player_weapon = "Throwing knives"
    -> arena_intro
* Hand-to-hand combat
